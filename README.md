### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Accessibility
- background properties
- position layout

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<main>
   <section class="follower-numbers">
        <ul>
          <li class="number">80K</li>
          <li class="desc">Followers</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li class="number">803K</li>
          <li class="desc">Likes</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li class="number">1.4K</li>
          <li class="desc">Photos</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
```

```css
body {
  background-color: hsl(185, 75%, 39%);
  background-image: url(images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg),
    url(images/bg-pattern-top.svg);
  background-position: left 50vw top 40vh, right 46vw bottom 50vh;
  background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: hsl(185, 75%, 39%);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  font-family: 'Fraunces';
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

i will focus on using flexbox layout in the future projects. These concepts am comfortable with and i found tit very useful .

i will focus on using relative units vh or vw it helps me to write short and clean code .

i will focus on specificity using class or id selectors .

i will focus on  using position layout .

i will focus on  using background properties .
